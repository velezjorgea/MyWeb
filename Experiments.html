							<!-- <span class="image right"><img alt="" src="images/pic03.jpg"></span>-->
							Experiment 1 is a simple pit-trading market with the following rules.  Each participant is assigned a role as a supplier or a demander of "apples."   Suppliers can sell at most one unit (a bushel)   and demanders can buy at most one unit.  Each supplier is  assigned one of two possible ``seller costs'' and each demander is  assigned one of  two possible ``buyer values''  for a bushel of apples  Buyers and sellers are asked to roam around the room and try to make make as profitable a deal as possible.   When a seller and a buyer agree on a price, they write  this price on a sales contract, along with their identification numbers and the  seller cost and  buyer value.  The market manager records transaction prices on the blackboard for all to see as the contracts are turned in.    If a seller with seller cost  C sells a unit at price P  to a buyer with buyer value B, then the seller's profit is  P-C   and the buyer's profit is B-C. 

							This experiment included two different  sessions with  different distributions of buyer values and seller costs in each session.  Each session consists of two rounds.   In the second round of each session,  the distribution of buyer values and seller costs is the same as in the first round.  In the second round, however, participants  can  use any information they have gained from participating in the first round  and  from observing the list of first-round transaction prices.

<h1  >Competitive Demand and Supply in Session 1</h1>
<p>The exact  number of persons with each buyer value and seller cost will, of course,  depend on  class size,  but we have arranged the distribution so that the competitive price and the main qualitative features of supply and demand are the same for all class sizes.   For example,  a class of 47  students would have 8 demanders with buyer values of $40, and 16 demanders with buyer values of $20.  There would also be 15 suppliers with seller costs of $10 and 8 suppliers with seller costs of $30.
Figure 1.1 below shows the competitive supply and demand curve and the competitive equilibrium price and quantity  in Session 1 with a class  47 students.   As we see from the graph, the  competitive equilibrium price is  $20 and the competitive equilibrium quantity is 15 units sold.</p>

<h1  >Prices in Session 1</h1>

<p>Participants in the market are not told anything about the distribution of Buyer Values and Seller Costs.  They know only their own values and anything they find out by talking to other participants.   Typically, they participate in this market before they have even studied the theory of supply and demand.  But even if they were familiar with competitive equilibrium theory,  students would not know the demand curve or the supply curve and thus would not know the competitive equilibrium price at the time they make their trades.
Since individuals have very limited knowledge of market conditions when they participate in the first round,  we would not expect  all transactions  to take place at or close to the competitive equilibrium price.  Nevertheless, the data shows that in the first round of Session 1,  the average price observed in most classrooms is strikingly  close to the competitive equilibrium price. This can be seen in  Figure 1.2, which records the distribution of mean prices across the 32 classrooms for which we have data. </p>

<p>In the second round,  as traders learned more about the prices at which others bought and sold, the mean prices in classrooms tended to cluster closer to the competitive equilibrium price of $20, with mean prices remaining slightly higher than the competitive price.  This is shown in Figure below</p>

  <p>We have also recorded and plotted the distribution of all recorded transactions in all sections.  In Figure 1.4, the purple line shows the distribution of transaction prices in Round 1 and the yellow line shows the distribution in Round 2.  Notice that in round 1, there are large numbers of transactions at the  "focal" prices $15, $25, $30, and $35.  In Round 2, the number of transactions at these prices dimishes, while there is an increase in  the number of transactions that take place at prices close to the competitive equilibrium price of  $20. </p>
