							<!-- <span class="image right"><img alt="" src="images/pic03.jpg"></span>-->
							<p> The course introduces students to the topic of innovation as a major force for economic growth and innovation policies aimed at promoting technological development and innovation. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with government policies to support innovation, to guide them through the empirical research on these topics, and let them explore interesting research questions on their own.</p>

							<p>During the course, we study some general questions on innovation activities of firms, such as the link between R\&D, innovation, and productivity, and the ways of organizing for innovation, in particular, knowledge sourcing strategies; we then discuss how government intervention, more specifically, patent protection, government funded R\&D, and trade reforms, influences firms’ innovation output. We also review and discuss the empirical research on these topics.</p>

							<p>By completing this course the students should be able to: 1) understand relevant determinants and performance implications of firm innovation activities; 2) explain and discuss the public policies for stimulating innovation and their underlying rationale; 3) assess the impact of these policies using methods from the empirical studies.</p>

							<h1 class="minor">Course Goal</h1>

							The main goal of the course is for the student to understand the rationale, working and evaluation of innovation policy instruments. With regard to the rationale and working, we will focus on both a general vision of economic rationales that justify the intervention of governments in the promotion of knowledge, and on specific factors influencing innovation policy. With regard to evaluation, we will focus on an econometric evaluation of innovation policies measures.

							<h1 class="minor">Course Structure</h1>
							The course starts with an overview lecture. It then continues with the execution of a number of tasks, some of which take the form of assignments. The tasks are presented in three broad stages. The first of these stages covers a general outlook on the role of innovation for economic growth and productivity. The second stage shifts attention to the rationales behind innovation policies. The third and final stage looks at policy evaluation.

							<h1 class="minor">Method of Instruction</h1>
							The course follows the problem based learning (PBL). Instead of ingesting knowledge, students construct their own knowledge! This is done in seven straightforward steps, which revolve around a specific task (or "problem"). Here you will find an overview of the PBL skills needed

							<!--<p>As far as my evaluation methods are concerned, I am always trying to deviate from standard evaluation approaches. I usually use formative assessment as students are learning. In every subject, I often adjust the teaching based on what students know at each point. I use means of technology to carry out my evaluations Live Quiz Games on "Quizlet", and instant feedback on "Socrative". For written exams, using the student's performance I design my questionnaires, laying down questions that push the student to develop analytical and critical answers. For instance, in Business Economics I use real case scenarios to set up the problem and ask the students to analyse it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GliSymqa7xmPprN6xIjD0x0Ic2uHUjl5/view?usp=sharing}{See an Example" target="_blank" >See an example.</a></li></p>-->
